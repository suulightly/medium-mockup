      <h1>The perils of learning to handstand</h1>

    <h2>Why Handstanding Makes No Sense</h2>
    <p>See, the way humans are built - legs are typically much, much stronger than arms.
      In an average person, the legs are able to push roughly four times as much weight as the arms can pull.
      It therefore makes absolutely no sense, none at all, why a human with perfectly functioning legs would want to think about standing on his/her hands.
      None at all.
    </p>
    <h2>Why People Want to Handstand Anyway</h2>
    <p>Perhaps people are simply bored. Or it's some residual monkey-like gene.
      I choose to think it's because of that insatiable need to constantly be pushing and striving for more.
      A need to challenge your limits. Although why these limits couldn't be "number of pints you can knock back before passing out" is, well, is beyond me.
      To each his or her own I suppose. Pick your poison, as they say.

    <h2>How to Make Sure You Don't Kill Yourself</h2>
    <p>If you choose to embark on this journey, you'll inevitably find it's full of ups and downs.
      You'll take forever to find the courage to even flip yourself upside down. The struggle for endurance will be another battle.
      Don't forget building all the upper body and shoulder strength you should have known you'd need.
      Then there's the million tiny little things you <strong>must</strong> keep in mind everytime you try standing on your hands.
      <ul>
        <li>Spider fingers gripping the hell out of that ground</li>
        <li>Core in, ribs in (how is one expected to know how to do all this upside down??)</li>
        <li>Shoulders pushed up towards the ears, constantly pushing - tired? Push even harder</li>
        <li>Gaze (or drishti, as yogis call it) fixed on an unmoving point</li>
        <li>Tailbone tucked, glutes engaged, quads engaged, feet pointed</li>
      </ul>
      Honestly, the list goes on forever. <br>
      <br>
      But, you know, as they say, effort before effortless.
      First comes endurance, then comes balance, then finally shape. <br>
